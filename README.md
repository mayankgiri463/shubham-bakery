This is a project I am making as an assignment from Gluu for an intern position

You need to download the whole repository into a folder

This folder then needs to be run on app.py but before that we need to create a database connection

Run the following commands in the terminal of Python in the current virtual environment
>>> from app import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> exit()

This will make up the database and connection is done priorly in the code
Run app.py file and go to the link as 
http://127.0.0.1:3000/

The video demo of the following assignment is in the drive link below:
